                A General Officer is an officer of high rank in the army, and in some nations' air forces or marines.
                [a]The term "general" is used in two ways: as the generic title for all grades of general officer and 
                as a specific rank. It originates in the 16th century, as a shortening of captain general, which rank 
                was taken from Middle French capitaine général. The adjective general had been affixed to officer 
                designations since the late medieval period to indicate relative superiority or an extended jurisdiction.

            <p>
                Lieutenant general, lieutenant-general and similar (abbrev Lt Gen, LTG and similar) is a three-star military 
                rank (NATO code OF-8) used in many countries. The rank traces its origins to the Middle Ages, where the title 
                of lieutenant general was held by the second in command on the battlefield, who was normally subordinate to a 
                captain general.In modern armies, lieutenant general normally ranks immediately below general and above major 
                general; it is equivalent to the navy rank of vice admiral, and in air forces with a separate rank structure, 
                it is equivalent to air marshal

                Major general (abbreviated MG, Maj. Gen. and similar) is a military rank used in many countries. 
                It is derived from the older rank of sergeant major general.The disappearance of the "sergeant" 
                in the title explains the apparently confusing phenomenon whereby a lieutenant general outranks a 
                major general while a major outranks a lieutenant.
